1.4.3
  - Rebuilt Swift framework with Xcode 7.3 to avoid Xcode error
    "Module file was created by an older version of the compiler".

  - Swift: Added SMSVerification constructor that takes
    application-specific "custom" data.

1.4.2
  - Workaround for possible App Store submission issues due to that
    SinchVerification.framework contains a universal / FAT binary that
    also contains iOS Simulator architectures (i386, x86_64):
    
    Add strip-frameworks.sh script to the Swift flavor of
    SinchVerification.framework. This script should be setup to run as
    part of an Xcode "Run Script Phase". See the documentation / User
    Guide for details on how to set this up.
