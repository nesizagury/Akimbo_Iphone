## Documentation

The User Guide is available in `docs/` (or
[https://www.sinch.com/docs/verification/ios/](https://www.sinch.com/docs/verification/ios/))

Reference docs for the Objective-C APIs: `objc/docs/reference/html/index.html`

Reference docs for the Swift APIs: `swift/docs/reference/html/index.html`

## Objective-C and Swift

The SDK package contains two different `SinchVerification.framework`
bundles, one in the directory `objc/`, and one in `swift/`.

The framework bundle in `objc/` contains a _static library framework_
(only Objective-C, no Swift modules), and the framework bundle in `swift/` is a
_dynamic framework_ for use with Swift applications and iOS deployment
target >= iOS 8.0. See the User Guide for more details on how to use
the different flavors of the Sinch Verification SDK.
